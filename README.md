A simple algorithm to enable cantor pairing has a small test

A simple library to do cantor pairing
Call the cantor_pair function to generate a unique id 
Call the cantor_unpair function to get the unique numbers that relate to that one id

Notes:
Not sure how efficient this is but it works lol
I can't republish to crates.io to change the name. Oh well

Mostly using it for my own development but if someone else wants to use it then go crazy
